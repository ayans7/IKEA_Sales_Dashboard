# Power BI Dashboard for IKEA's Online Sales Analysis
# Project Overview
IKEA, a global leader in home furnishings, wanted to enhance its ability to track and analyze online sales performance across India. The business owner required a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor key sales metrics, identify high-value customers, and optimize sales strategies in real time.
