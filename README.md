# Power BI Dashboard for IKEA's Online Sales Analysis
# Project Overview
IKEA, a global leader in home furnishings, wanted to enhance its ability to track and analyze online sales performance across India. The business owner required a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor key sales metrics, identify high-value customers, and optimize sales strategies in real time.
# Business Problem
IKEA needed a centralized solution to:
•	Track and analyze online sales data across multiple regions in India.
•	Identify high-value customers and understand purchasing behavior.
•	Enable real-time sales tracking and performance optimization.

•	Applied DAX calculations to generate meaningful insights (e.g., total sales, revenue growth, customer segmentation).

Dashboard Features & Functionalities
•	Dynamic Filtering & Drill-Down
o	Implemented complex parameters for multi-level drill-down analysis.
o	Added interactive filters and slicers to allow users to segment data by region, product category, time period, and customer segment.
•	Customized Visualizations
o	Used a variety of charts and graphs, including:
	Bar Chart & Clustered Bar Chart – Sales trends and regional comparisons.
	Pie Chart & Donut Chart – Product category distribution.
	Scatter Chart – Customer spending patterns.
	Line & Area Charts – Monthly and yearly sales trends.
	Maps – Geospatial visualization of online sales across different states.
	Slicers – Enabling dynamic data exploration.
•	High-Value Customer Identification
o	Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to identify top customers.
o	Created customer segmentation dashboards for targeted marketing strategies.
•	Real-Time Updates & Performance Tracking
o	Enabled real-time data refresh to track sales trends dynamically.
o	Provided automated insights to help the sales team optimize marketing and inventory strategies.
